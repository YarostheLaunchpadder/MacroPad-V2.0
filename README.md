# MacroPad-V2.0
#### Total rewrite of the original MacroPad software by me!

MacroPad is a software designed to allow people with a launchpad to map the pads on the midi controller to keys on the keyboard or even combinations to play games, automate tasks, switch scenes while streaming, etc... But it was never complete, only presets in the app were available, and no more, that's why I decided to totally rewrite the software! While I design the new MacroPad app, you should download and try using the original software [here](https://github.com/YarostheLaunchpadder/MacroPad)!
